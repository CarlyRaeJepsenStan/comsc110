1. Objective: calculate how many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment.
2. Requirements: 
A. the number of years in which I've've lived, including your birth year and the current year
B. the number of leap years in my life
C. the number of days in my birth year before I was born, including my day of birth
D. the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that
date. 


INPUT (any data items to be input):
-numYears
-numLeapYears
-daysBeforeBirth
-daysRemaining


PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become 
the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate how many days old the user will be by due date
4. output with labels


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) :
objective: calculate how many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment
author:
instructions: make sure to input date of birth, due date, years lived, leap years, and days before birth, and days remaining after due date 
- user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user 
instructions/rules
- Date of Birth
- Assignment Due Date
- Number of Days

Labels: 
"DOB", date of birth
"Due," due date
"Age", in days (calculated) 

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type [integer, decimal, 
text, single character], formatting, or any other specifications):

-numYears [int]: the number of years in which you've lived, including your birth year and the current year
-numLeapYears [int]: the number of leap years in your life
-numDaysofBirthYear [int]: the number of days in your birth year before you were born, including your day of birth
-daysRemaining [int]: the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that date. 
-dateOfBirth [string]: Aug 9 2004
-dueDate [string]: Jun 16 2022
-days [int]: number of days between date of birth and due date

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)

set numYears=programmer input
set numLeapYears=programmer input
set numDaysBefore=programmer input
set daysRemaining=programmer input
set dateOfBirth=programmer input
set dueDate=programmer input
set days = 0

output label "Date of Birth" 
output dateOfBirth
output label "Assignment Due Date"
output dueDate
output "Age"
days = days + numYears * 365
days = days + numLeapYears
set days = days - daysRemaining
set days = days - numDaysBefore
output days

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and 
expected results)
Test case #1:

Purpose: Ensure the algorithm works as expected
Inputs: Programmer inputs
Expected Results: 6,521 days


set numYears=19
set numLeapYears=6
set numDaysBefore=221
set daysRemaining=199
set dateOfBirth="Aug 9, 2004"
set dueDate="Jun 16, 2022
set days = 0

output label "Date of Birth" 
output dateOfBirth
output label "Assignment Due Date"
output dueDate
output "Age"
days = 0 + 19 * 365 = 65706935
days = 6935 + 6 = 6941
set days = 6941 - 199 = 6742
set days = 6742 - 221 = 6521
output days

999 END



Test case #2:



Purpose: Evaluate the algorithm with different values
Inputs: Programmer inputs:
Due date: Aug 07 2010
Birthdate: Jan 1 1999
Expected Results: 4,237 days

set numYears=12
set numLeapYears=3
set numDaysBefore=0
set daysRemaining=146
set dateOfBirth="Aug 7, 2010"
set dueDate="Jan 1, 1999"
set days = 0

output label "Date of Birth" 
output dateOfBirth
output label "Assignment Due Date"
output dueDate
output "Age"

days = 0 + 12 * 365 = 4380
days = 4380 + 3 = 4383
set days = 4383 - 146 = 4238
set days = 4238 - 1 = 4237
output days
999 END
