1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do):  make a more complex encoder

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- read a file containing the information to encode

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read input
4. [array] array of offsets, read from file
5. generate random numbers for offets, between -20 to 20
6. decrement each character's unicode value by the corresponding offset
7. output decoded values to the console

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-decoded string to console

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-input
-random numbers used to offset the input
-encrypted string

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set data to file contents
20 set i = 0;
30 read contents of file offset.txt and save to offset array
***introduction 
40 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 decrement each char's unicode value by i % SIZE value in offset array
70 output decoded value

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: ensure the algorithm works properly
***data
10 set data to file contents: the gibbiersh from encoder2-algorithm
20 set i = 0;
30 read contents of file offset.txt and save to offset array: 16 -20 3 -13 -1 -14 
***introduction 
40 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 decrement each char's unicode value by i % SIZE value in offset array
70 output decoded value: "I really like computer programming!"
