1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): make a simple quiz program

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- [char] user answers 

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read user input and compare to correct answer

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-whether the user got the answer right or wrong
-number of questions answered correctly

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-question [string] true or false, the integer data type can hold an infinite amount of numbers [t/f]
-question [string] boolean can have a) one b) two c) three different values
-question [string] hexadecimal is base a)16 b)17 c) 18

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set score to 0
20 define quiz question function
21 output question
22 input guess
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 output quiz question
50 collect user guess
60 compare answer and guess
70 if guess = answer, increase score by 1 and output "Correct!"
80 otherwise, output "Incorrect!"
90 repeat until all the questions are exhausted
100 output score

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
***data
***data
10 set score to 0
20 define quiz question function
21 output question
22 input guess
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 output quiz question: true or false, the integer data type can hold an infinite amount of numbers [t/f]
50 collect user guess - t
60 compare answer and guess 
70 if guess = answer, increase score by 1 and output "Correct!"
80 otherwise, output "Incorrect!" <-- Incorrect! 
90 output quiz question: boolean can have a) one b) two c) three different values
100: collect user guess - b 
110: Correct! 
120: score ++
130 output: hexadecimal is base a)16 b)17 c) 18 
140: input: b 
150: correct!
160: score++
170: output Thanks for playing, you scored 2/3
