1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Make a simple guessing game where the user receives input about the quality of their guess.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- [int] user input

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. game loop
4. output

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
- user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- [feedback] That's too high
- [feedback] That's too low
- [feedback] Type a number between 1-100
- [feedback] You guessed it!
- [end] Thanks for playing! 


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- random number
- user input

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 set myNumber to a random number between 1 and 100
30 set guess to user input, set int = 0;
40 compare guess and myNumber
50 if guess = myNumber output end of game messages and jump to 999 end
60 score ++ , write score to file
70 if guess > myNumber output "That's too high"
80 if guess < myNumber output "That's too low"
90 jump to instruction 20


999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Purpose: ensure the algorithm works as expected
10 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
20 set myNumber to a random number between 1 and 100 = 30
30 set guess to user input = 50
40 compare guess and myNumber
50 if guess = myNumber output end of game messages and jump to 999 end
60 if guess > myNumber output "That's too high" <- true
70 if guess < myNumber output "That's too low" 
80 jump to instruction 20
90 set guess to user input = 40
100 if guess = myNumber output end of game messages and jump to 999 end
110 if guess > myNumber output "That's too high" <- true
120 if guess < myNumber output "That's too low" 
130 set guess to user input = 30
140 if guess = myNumber output end of game messages and jump to 999 end <- true
150 output "Thanks for playing!"
160 increment score
170 write score to file
180 exit
