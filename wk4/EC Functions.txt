1. Copy the following questions and write your answer below each question, separated by one blank line between questions and answers.

a. what are all the kinds of functions in C++?
The four sources of functions in C++ are programmer defined, library, builtins, and the main function.  The two kinds of functions are void and value returning functions. 

b. What are the 2 types of functions in C++, and how does each type of function work?

The two types of functions are void and value returning functions.  Void functions return nothing, and usually output something to the console, while value returning functions 

c. When are functions used?
Functions are used to make code more concise and easy to read, such as when some code needs to be repeated.  

d. Where do functions go in a program, and in what order should we list functions?

Functions should be listed in the order they are used at the top of the program file, between the main function and the libraries declared at the top.  

e. What are parameters, what are they used for, how many can you have, and how are they documented?
Parameters are values a function takes in, defined in the parentheses following the function name.  They are used to simplify complicated processes that happen in a program.  You can use as many parameters are you like - there is no limit, except maybe the size of the computer's memory.  

f. Can a function call another function?
Yes

g. What is a function prototype?
A function prototype is a promise to the compiler that the function will be defined later on in the code.  Function prototypes are used to 

h. What is the first code block in a function and what are the first few statements and why?

The first few statements of a program are the library imports and then the programmer-defined functions.  This improves readability for any future readers of the code.
