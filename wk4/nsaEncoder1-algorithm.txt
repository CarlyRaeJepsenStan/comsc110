1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do):  make a simple encoder

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- read a file containing the information to encode

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read input
4. encode input by incrementing each char by 1

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-encoded information into file

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-input

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set data to file contents
20 set i = 0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 increment each char's unicode value by 1
60 save encoded value to file

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: ensure the algorithm works properly
3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set data to file contents = "I really like computer programming!"
20 set i = 0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 increment each char's unicode value by 1 - J!sfbmmz!mjlf!dpnqvufs!qsphsbnnjoh"
60 save encoded value to file -> secrets.txt

999 END
