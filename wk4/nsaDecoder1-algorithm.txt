1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): make a simple decoder

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- file containing encoded data

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read file data
4. decrement each character's unicode value by 1
5. output value to console

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-decoded value

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-file input - encoded data
-console output - decoded data

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set data to file contents
20 set i = 0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 decrement each char's unicode value by 1
60 output decoded value to console

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: ensure the algorithm works properly
3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set data to file contents = J!sfbmmz!mjlf!dpnqvufs!qsphsbnnjoh"
20 set i = 0
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 for i = 0; i < length of file contents, increment i by 1:
50 increment each char's unicode value by 1 - I really like computer programming! 
60 output the decoded string to console

999 END
