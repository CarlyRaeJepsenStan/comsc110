2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-player's move

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):

2. user introduction
3. generate computer's move
4. receive player's move
5. compare moves and announce winner or tie 
5a. assign the values: rock 0, paper 1, scissor 2
