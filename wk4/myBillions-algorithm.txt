1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
calculate how long it will take to earn a certain amount of money

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-none

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. begin incrementing amount of wealth
4. find how long it takes for wealth to grow to target value, if you double how much you save each week


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-how long in weeks it takes to reach 

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-target value
-number of weeks

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set wealth to 0
20 set accumulating function:
21 loop: every time the loop runs, i *= 5 and time += 1
22 wealth += 2 * i
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
40 continue running loop until target value is reached
50 output "It will take you " time " weeks to become a " type specified previously

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
10 set wealth to 0
20 set time to 0
30 start accumulating function:
40 type = thousandaire
50 target = 1000
60 loop: every time the loop runs, i *= 5 and time += 1
70 wealth += 2 * i
80 output: 8 weeks to be a thousandaire
90 type = millionaire
100 target = 1000000
110 loop: every time the loop runs, i *= 5 and time += 1
120 wealth += 2 * i
130 output: 18 weeks to be a millionaire
140 type = billionaire
150 target = 1000000000
160 loop: every time the loop runs, i *= 5 and time += 1
170 wealth += 2 * i
180 output: 28 weeks to be a billionaire.
