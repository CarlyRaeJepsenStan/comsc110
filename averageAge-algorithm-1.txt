1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Find the average of all the ages inputted. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-age

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):

-print "Please type your age"
-read user input of age, as an integer
-add recorded age to total age
-increase number of people by 1
-print total age/number of people


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-objective: find the average of all the age typed in
-author: Aaron Shey
-prompt: "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
-label "The average of the age inputted are:
-error: "Invalid: age must be an integer between 10 and 112"

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-age = [integer] someone's age in feet between 10 to 112
-count = [integer] number of people typed in
-sum = [integer] sum of everyone's age
-averageAge = [decimal] average of all the ages typed in

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
5 sum = 0
6 count = 0
7 averageAge = 0
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
40 input age
45 if age is less than 10 or greater than 112 then output error message and repeat previous command
46 if age is quit, jump to 999 end
50 sum = sum + age
60 count = count + 1
70 averageAge = sum / count
80 output label "The average of the ages inputted are:"
90 output averageAge
100 jump to instruction 30


if input = quit or user doesn't input anything for 5 minutes
999 END
1000 output "Thanks for using this program!"

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Purpose: Verify the algorithm works as expected
Inputs: One person is 18 and one person is 17 in the class. 
Expected results: average is 17.5

5 sum = 0
6 count = 0
7 averageAge = 0
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
35 if age is less than 10 or greater than 112 then output error message and repeat previous command
36 if age is quit, jump to 999 end
40 input age = 18
50 sum = 0 + 18 = 5
60 count = 0 + 1 = 1
70 averageAge = sum / count
80 output label "The average of the ages inputted are:"
90 output averageAge = 18
100 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
105 if age is less than 10 or greater than 112 then output error message and repeat previous command
106 if age is quit, jump to 999 end
110 input age = 5.0
120 sum = 18 + 17 = 35
130 count = 1 + 1 = 2
140 averageAge = sum / count
150 output label "The average of the ages inputted are:"
160 output averageAge = 17.5
170 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
180 input age = quit
999 END
1000 output "Thanks for using this program!"

Test case #2: 
Purpose: Verify the algorithm works as expected
Inputs: Both people in the class are 20 years old. 
Expected results: average is 20 

5 sum = 0
6 count = 0
7 averageAge = 0
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
35 if age is less than 10 or greater than 112 then output error message and repeat previous command
36 if age is quit, jump to 999 end
40 input age = 20
50 sum = 0 + 20
60 count = 0 + 1 = 1
70 averageAge = sum / count
80 output label "The average of the ages inputted are:"
90 output averageAge = 20
100 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
105 if age is less than 10 or greater than 112 then output error message and repeat previous command
106 if age is quit, jump to 999 end
110 input age = 20
120 sum = 20 + 20 = 40
130 count = 1 + 1 = 2
140 averageAge = sum / count
150 output label "The average of the ages inputted are:"
160 output averageAge = 20
170 output prompt "What is your age? Type a whole number between 10 and 112, or quit to end the program"
180 input age = quit
999 END
1000 output "Thanks for using this program!"




Test case #3:
Purpose: End the algorithm immediately
Inputs: The user types in quit immediately
Expected results: the algorithm quits immediately

5 sum = 0
6 count = 0
7 averageAge = 0

40 if iage is quit, jump to 999 end
50 input age = quit
999 END
1000 output "Thanks for using this program!"
