1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- [decimal] height of lighthouse 

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate visibility distance from height 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-height of lighthouse
-visible distance of lighthouse 

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- [decimal] height of lighthouse
- [decimal] distance the lighthouse is visible from

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)

10 set height of lighthouse to user input
20 set visible distance of lighthouse to the square root of 0.8 * lighthouse height
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules

999 END





4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Purpose: ensure the algorithm works as instructed
Expected output: A 100 ft tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away
10 set height of lighthouse to user input = 100
20 set visible distance of lighthouse to the square root of 0.8 * lighthouse height = sqrt(100 * 0.8) = 8.9
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
40 set decimal precision to 0 decimal points 
50 output label "The lighthouse can be seen from "
60 output visible distance of lighthouse

999 END
