1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Create a simple guessing game with numbers between 1 to 10.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- [int] guess

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. generate random number
4. compare user guess and random number
5. continue comparison until they are equal

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
- user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- [feedback] I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
- [feedback] You guessed it!
- [error] Try again...
- [feedback] Thanks for playing!

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- user input [int]

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
10 set myNumber to randomly generated number
20 get user's guess from console
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
40 compare user's guess and my number
50 if the guess doesn't match the number, go to instruction 20
60 if the guess matches the number, output "You guessed it!"

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: test the algorithm's logic
10 set myNumber to randomly generated number = 3
20 get user's guess from console = 1
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
40 compare user's guess and my number
50 if the guess doesn't match the number, go to instruction 20 and output "Try again"
60 get user's guess from console = 2
70 compare user's guess and my number
80 if the guess doesn't match the number, go to instruction 20 and output "Try again"
90 get user's guess from console = 3
100 compare user's guess and my number
110 if the guess matches the number, output "You guessed it!" and "Thanks for playing!"

999 END
