1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): simulate the card game war

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-sentinel value: y or n

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. generate random values and suites for the computer and player card
4. compare values and output win status


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-win, loss, or tie
-play again?

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-computer suite
-computer card value
-human suite
-human card value

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 create struct SuiteStruct with fields suite (string) and suitevalue (int)
20 create struct playingcard, with fields value (int) and SuiteStruct
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
35 get sentinel
36 if sentinel = n quit
40 create humanCard, with type playingcard
50 generate random number between 2 and 14 for humanCard's value
60 generate another random number between 0 to 3 
70 suite(random number between 0 to 3) = humanCard suiteStruct suite
80 the same previous random number = humanCard suiteStruct 
90 humanScore = humanCard value + humanCard suiteStruct value
100 generate random number between 2 and 14 for computerCard's value
110 generate another random number between 0 to 3 
120 suite(random number between 0 to 3) = computerCard suiteStruct suite
130 the same previous random number = computerCard suiteStruct 
140 computerScore = computerCard value + computerCard suiteStruct value
150 computerScore = computerCard + computerCard suiteStruct value
160 compare computer score and human score and output result

1000 function suite()
1010 return 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
expected result: quit immediately
***data
10 create struct SuiteStruct with fields suite (string) and suitevalue (int)
20 create struct playingcard, with fields value (int) and SuiteStruct
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
35 get sentinel
36 if sentinel = n quit
999 END

Test case #2: ensure the program works correctly
***data
10 create struct SuiteStruct with fields suite (string) and suitevalue (int)
20 create struct playingcard, with fields value (int) and SuiteStruct
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
35 get sentinel
36 if sentinel = n quit
40 create humanCard, with type playingcard
50 generate random number between 2 and 14 for humanCard's value: 14
60 generate another random number between 0 to 3: 3
70 suite(random number between 0 to 3) = humanCard suiteStruct suite: Club
80 the same previous random number = humanCard suiteStruct: 3
90 humanScore = humanCard value + humanCard suiteStruct value: 17

100 generate random number between 2 and 14 for computerCard's value: 2
110 generate another random number between 0 to 3 : 0
120 suite(random number between 0 to 3) = computerCard suiteStruct suite: spades
130 the same previous random number = computerCard suiteStruct : 0
140 computerScore = computerCard value + computerCard suiteStruct value: 2
160 compare computer score and human score and output result: human wins!
170 get sentinel
180 sentinel = n
