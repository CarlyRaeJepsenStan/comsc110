1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
calculate the factorial of a number
2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-number to calculate the factorial with

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. cumulative multiply every integer between 1 and the number given, inclusive 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
- [label] the factorial of <input> is
- [int] result of factorial calculation

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- input: number to calculate factorial
- output: factorial

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 prompt user to type in number
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 calculate factorial with a loop:
40 set factorial to 1
50 for every integer between 1 and input, cumulatively multiply the numbers
60 if integer is 0, output 1
70 output factorial with label 

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: user types in 1

***data
10 prompt user to type in number: 1
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 calculate factorial with a loop:
40 set factorial to 1
50 for every integer between 1 and input, cumulatively multiply the numbers
60 if integer is 0, output 1
70 output factorial with label: 1 

999 END


Test case #2: user input 0
expected output: 1
***data
10 prompt user to type in number: 0
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 calculate factorial with a loop:
40 set factorial to 1
50 for every integer between 1 and input, cumulatively multiply the numbers
60 if integer is 0, output 1 <- OUTPUT 1
70 output factorial with label 

999 END

Test case #3: user input 2
expected output: 2
***data
10 prompt user to type in number: 2
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 calculate factorial with a loop:
40 set factorial to 1
50 for every integer between 1 and input, cumulatively multiply the numbers
60 if integer is 0, output 1
70 output factorial with label: 2 * 1 = 2, the factorial of 2 is 2 

999 END
