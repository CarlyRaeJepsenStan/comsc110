1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
make a simple movie guessing game

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-movies.txt, containing movie title, release year, and then a blank line

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read movie title and year and save to an object
4. form a list of the movie objects 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-[prompt] What year was [movie title] released?
-[char] sentinel, y or n
-[response] Sorry, the correct release year was [release year]
-[response] That's correct!

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-movies
-list of movie objects
-user input - year
-user input - sentinel

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 create an object Movie with items title [string] and year [number]
20 create a mutable list with each element being type Movie
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 open movies.txt
50 read first line and save to title
60 read second line and save to year
70 skip blank line
80 continue until end of file is reached
90 pick a random location in the list of movies
100 output movie title and ask when it was released
110 input user guess
120 if the user guess matches the year, output correct
130 else, output wrong
140 prompt to continue playing


999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: user doesn't want to play
expected result: exits immediately 
***data
10 create an object Movie with items title [string] and year [number]
20 create a mutable list with each element being type Movie
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 open movies.txt
50 read first line and save to title
60 read second line and save to year
70 skip blank line
80 continue until end of file is reached
90 pick a random location in the list of movies
100 output movie title and ask when it was released
110 input user guess
120 if the user guess matches the year, output correct
130 else, output wrong
140 prompt to continue playing: user types n, end




Test case #2: user guesses wrong once: 
***data
10 create an object Movie with items title [string] and year [number]
20 create a mutable list with each element being type Movie
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
40 open movies.txt
50 read first line and save to title
60 read second line and save to year
70 skip blank line
80 continue until end of file is reached
90 pick a random location in the list of movies
100 output movie title and ask when it was released: "When was Morbius released?" 
110 input user guess: 2022
120 if the user guess matches the year, output correct: Correct!
130 else, output wrong
140 prompt to continue playing


999 END
