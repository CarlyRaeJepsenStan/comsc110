1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
calculate a fibonacci sequence


2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-index of sequence

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. start from 0 and calculate the fibonacci sequence up until the index given 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-fibonnaci sequence

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 get user input index
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 while counter is less than user input
40 print fib(user input)

1000 function fib
1010 accept index
1020 calculate and return list of fibonacci numbers

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: input is 0 or 1
expected result: 0 or 1
10 get user input
20 user input is 1
30 output 1

999 END

Test case #2: input is 2
10 get user input
20 user input is 2
30 output fib{0}: 1
40 output fib (1): 1
50 output fib(2): 2
