1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Play the card game war against the user.


2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-none

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
	generate a random number from 2-14 to represent a card for the computer
Output the computer's card's value, outputting 2-10 as that value, but output 11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
generate a random number from 0-3 to represent a card's suit for the computer
Output the computer's card's suit, but output 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
For the human player:
generate a random number from 2-14 to represent a card for the user
Output the user's card's value, outputting 2-10 as that value, but output 11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
generate a random number from 0-3 to represent a card's suit for the user
Output the user's card's suit, but output 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
Determine the winner:
If the computer's card's value is LESS than the human's card's value, output "Human wins!"
If the computer's card's value is EQUAL TO the human's card's value, output "It's a tie."
If the computer's card's value is GREATER than the human's card's value, output "Computer wins!"

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-computer's value and suite
-human's value and suite
-status: win, loss, etc

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
10 generate random numbers for human and computer card suite and values
20 output corresponding suites and values
30 sum the values and suites and compare them
40 output result depending on who has a higher value
50 if there is a tie, tell the user to rerun the program

999 END


4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
10 generate random numbers for human and computer card suite and values - 4 of hearts, 3 of spades (computer, human)
20 output corresponding suites and values - 4 of hearts, 3 of spades (computer, human)	
30 sum the values and suites and compare them - computer has 6, human has 4 - human wins 
40 output result depending on who has a higher value - You win! 
50 if there is a tie, tell the user to rerun the program

999 END
