1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Find the average of all the heights inputted. 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-height: console input
-number of people: programmer input

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):

-print "Please type your height"
-read user input of height, as a floating point integer
-add recorded height to total height
-increase number of people by 1
-print total height/number of people

continue until number of heights inputted = number of people


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-objective: find the average of all the heights typed in
-author: Aaron Shey
-prompt: "What is your height, in feet?"
-label "The average of the heights inputted are:"
-averageHeight

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-height = someone's height in feet, as a floating point integer
-sizeOfClass = how many people expected
-sum = sum of everyone's height
-averageHeight = average of all the heights typed in

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
5 sum = 0
6 count = programmer input
7 averageHeight = 0
8 index = 0
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output prompt "What is your height, in feet? Type a decimal number between 3.0 and 7.0"
40 input height
45 if height is less than 3 or greater than 7, repeat previous output 
46 if height is quit, jump to 999 end
50 sum = sum + height
60 index = index + 1
70 averageHeight = sum / count
80 output label "The average of the heights inputted are:"
90 output averageHeight
100 index = index + 1
if index = count jump to 999 end

if input = quit or user doesn't input anything for 5 minutes
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
Everyone in the class is 5 ft tall, and there are 3 people in the class:

5 sum = 0
6 count = 3
7 averageHeight = 0
8 index = 0
10 output objective
20 output author
30 output prompt "What is your height, in feet? Type a decimal number between 3.0 and 7.0"
40 input height = 5.0
45 if height is less than 3 or greater than 7, repeat previous output 
46 if height is quit, jump to 999 end
50 sum = 0 + 5 = 5
60 index = 0 + 1 = 1
65 index does not equal count
70 averageHeight = sum / count
80 output label "The average of the heights inputted are:"
90 output averageHeight = 5
100 output prompt "What is your height, in feet? Type a decimal number between 3.0 and 7.0"
110 input height = 5.0
115 if height is less than 3 or greater than 7, repeat previous output 
116 if height is quit, jump to 999 end
120 sum = 5 + 5 = 10
130 index = 1 + 1 = 2
135 index is not equal to count
140 averageHeight = sum / count
150 output label "The average of the heights inputted are:"
160 output averageHeight = 5
170 output prompt "What is your height, in feet? Type a decimal number between 3.0 and 7.0"
175 if height is less than 3 or greater than 7, repeat previous output 
176 if height is quit, jump to 999 end
180 input height = 5.0
190 sum = 10 + 5 = 15
200 index = 1 + 2 = 3
205 count = index
210 averageHeight = sum / count
220 output label "The average of the heights inputted are:
230 output averageHeight = 5
240 output prompt "What is your height, in feet? Type a decimal number between 3.0 and 7.0"
250 input height = quit
255 if height is less than 3 or greater than 7, repeat previous output 
256 if height is quit, jump to 999 end
999 END
