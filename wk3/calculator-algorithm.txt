1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): 
Make a simple four function calculator.

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- [decimal] first number
- [decimal] second number
- [char] operation
- [char] sentinel value

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. get the inputs
4. if the sentinel is n, exit the loop otherwise continue 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-ask for first number
-ask for second number
-ask for operation
-ask for sentinel
-output result of calculation

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
- [decimal] first number
- [decimal] second number
- [char] operation
- [char] sentinel value

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set first number to user input
20 set second number to user input
30 set operation to user input
40 set sentinel to user input
50 perform calculation with inputs and output result
60 if sentinal is y, go to instruction 10
70 if sentinal is n, go to 999 END

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: Ensure the algorithm works as expected
10 set first number to user input = 1
20 set second number to user input = 2
30 set operation to user input = +
40 set sentinel to user input = N
50 perform calculation with inputs and output result = 3
60 if sentinal is y, go to instruction 10
70 if sentinal is n, go to 999 END

999 END
